# ML Project
This is the final assignment for Module 52954 "Machine Learning and Statistics", GMIT Higher Diploma in Computer Science. 

# Contents of files
- `Dockerfile` contains the programme for creating a Docker container to run the server in your browser
- `Machine Learning & Statistics Final Project` contains a Jupyter notebook examining the `powerproduction.csv` dataset
- `model.py` contains the machine learning code itself
- `model.h5` contains the machine learning model that is accessed through the web server
- `powerproduction.csv` contains the data on which the machine learning model was trained
- `requirements.txt` is a requirements file for the virtual environment and Docker container
- `server.py` contains the server
- `staticpages` folder contains two files:
    - `model_js` is the tensorflow.js model of the `model.py` code
    - `index.html` is the home page of the server

# Purpose of code
This code is in completion of the final assignment as specified above. It is a server that hosts a machine learning algorithm used to predict the power generated by a certain wind speed, trained on a dataset of roughly 400 datapoints.

# Setup
1. If you wish to run this server through the `server.py` file, you will need to download all files to the same directory, maintaining the file structure as used in this repository.
2. If you wish to use a Docker container, make sure you have Docker installed, and download all files to the same directory, maintaining the file structure as used in this repository

# Running the server using `server.py`
1. Start by running `server.py` on the command line: `python server.py`
2. Once the server is up and running, open up a web-browser and type in: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`
3. You will be greeted by a webpage containing a brief welcome message and a text input field

# Running the server using Docker
1. Create a Docker container image in the directory hosting the `Dockerfile` file by typing `docker build -t server-app .` in the command line interface. NOTE: creating this container might take a few minutes
2. Once the container is completed, enter the following command to run the container: `docker run -d -p 5000:5000 server-app`
3. Once the server is up and running, open up a web-browser and type in: `http://0.0.0.0:5000/`
4. You will be greeted by a webpage containing a brief welcome message and a text input field
5. To quit the container, type `docker kill [container number]` in the command line

# Using the webpage
1. Enter any positive number into the text field. Zero and negative numbers will return a zero
2. The predicted windspeed together with the number entered will be added to the table below.
3. You can continue to enter numbers, and they will be added in turn
4. To delete any row, simply hit the `delete` button at the end for the row

# Troubleshooting
- If you get a webpage error message, make sure your server is running.
